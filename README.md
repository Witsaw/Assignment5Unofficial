William Chen and Luis Monge

# Problem
There are many messenger applications that over complicate the process of communication with other users or make the process addictive which can waste user time that can be used in other more productive task.

# Audience
We plan to capture a broad audience with this application.

# Solution 
	We will be working on a real-time message application. This idea stood out from the others because of how flexible it is. For instance, we could work on adding things like video and images to the message.

# Language 
We plan to write everything, as of right now, in Python. We will probably use python libraries sockets for the sockets and tkinter for the UI.
